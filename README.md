# vdshell
small shell for embedded device

## requirements ##
```
go get github.com/abiosoft/ishell
go get github.com/jaypipes/ghw
go get github.com/shirou/gopsutil
go get github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter
```

## BuildÂ ##

If you want to use this shell in embedded device you should compile this program with static library. For do that just run the build.sh script file.

```
./build.sh
```

You should see vdshell executable file in the folder.
